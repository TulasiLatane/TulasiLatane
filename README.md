Project: Simple Calculator

Objective of the project:
The objective of a simple calculator project in Java is to create a basic application 
that can perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
This project helps in understanding the fundamentals of Java programming, including user input handling, basic arithmetic operations, 
and GUI (Graphical User Interface) development if a graphical calculator is desired.

Key Activities
Define Requirements and Design:
Decide on the features of the calculator (e.g., basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). 
Design the user interface (UI) if a GUI is being implemented (e.g., buttons for digits and operations, a display area). 

Set Up Development Environment:

Install Java Development Kit (JDK). Set up an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans. 
Implement the Calculator Logic:
Create a Calculator class to handle arithmetic operations. Implement methods for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Handle User Input:
For a console-based application, use Scanner to read input from the user. For a GUI- based application, set up event listeners for buttons.
Display Results:
For a console-based application, print the results to the console. For a GUI-based application, update the display area with the results. Test the Application:
Perform unit testing to ensure each arithmetic operation works correctly. Test the user interface to ensure it responds correctly to user inputs.

Technologies Used:
Java Standard Edition (Java SE): Core Java: Fundamental classes and APIs, such as java.lang and java.util. Swing/AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):
For creating the GUI components if a graphical calculator is being developed. Scanner. For handling user input in a console-based application.

Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans: For writing, debugging, and running the Java code.
